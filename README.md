# OdinShop
## About
Welcome to my Shopping Cart project, a culmination of my learning journey with The Odin Project! This web application is built using **React** and leverages the **React Router** library to create a seamless user experience. The project features three main pages:  

- **Home Page**: A welcoming landing page that introduces the app and its purpose.  
- **Shop Page**: Browse through a variety of items, add them to your cart, and see your selections update in real-time.  
- **Cart Page**: Review your selected items, adjust quantities, and proceed to checkout (simulated).  

This project was designed to strengthen my understanding of React fundamentals, state management, and routing. It also provided hands-on experience in creating a responsive and user-friendly interface.  

Feel free to explore and interact with the appâ€”Iâ€™m excited to share this milestone in my web development journey! ðŸš€
